# ansible-role-dokuwiki
Deploy and update Dokuwiki

Things to note about this repository:

- don't blindly deploy it without understanding how it works and testing it for your environment
- it is currently only used on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS, so may not work on other versions
- there is currently no real error checking, this is experimental at this stage so treat it with caution
- you will need to download _dokuwiki-stable.tgz_ from https://www.dokuwiki.org/ and place it in the files directory
- don't forget to customise the variables for your setup
